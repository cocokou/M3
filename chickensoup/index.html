        <blockquote class="courage">Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.  
       
       <p>If you want to make a difference, you have to think big and dream big from day one. </p>
       <p>What would you do if you weren't afraid.
Don't let your fear overwhelm your desire.</p>
       <p>Let the barriers you face,and they will be barriers, be external not internal.</p>
       <p>Fortune does favor the bold, and I promise that you will never know what you're capable of unless you try.</p>
 
I hope you find true meaning, contentment. and passion in your life.

        <blockquote class="">"我从来不相信什么懒洋洋的自由，我向往的自由是通过勤奋和努力实现的更广阔的人生，那样的自由才是珍贵的、有价值的；我相信一万小时定律，我从来不相信天上掉馅饼的灵感和坐等的成就。做一个自由又自律的人，靠势必实现的决心认真地活着。" <span>  —— 山本耀司</span></blockquote>
        <blockquote class="beSelfish">"When I came to the city I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."        <span> -- Game of Thrones S02E06</span></blockquote>
